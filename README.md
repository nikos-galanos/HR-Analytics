# HR-Analytics
Data Exploration / Visualization Project using Tableau.

## Introduction

This project is a Tableau visualization exercise using a dataset on HR Analytics. In particular, we take on the role of the HR team of the company who wants to track company attrition based on various factors, e.g. age, gender, department etc.

In order to be able to easily visualize the relevant KPIs, we utilize Tableau and we create an interactive dashboard that includes the following metrics:

- No of Employees, No of Attrition, Attrition Rate
- Distribution of Employees by age group
- Attrition Distribution by Gender
- Attrition Distribution by Department
- Attrition Distribution by Education
- Attrition Rate by Gender for each age group
- Job Satisfaction per Job Role

## Conclusions

Many relevant metrics could also be tracked on this dashboard. From our dashboard we immediately notice that people working in the R&D Department have the highest percentage of attrition, an insight that requires further investigation. Turning our attention to employee satisfaction rates, we notice that people with titles "Research Scientist", "Research Director" and "Laboratory Technician" are among those that most oftenly rate with the lowest possible score their satisfasction from their employment.

Another interesting insight is that most people that leave our company are peopl with age between 25 and 34, most of which are Males. This could be associated possibly with lack of career development opportunities, as this is usually the age that most people step into senior or managerial roles.


Further analysis will take place in a future dashboard!
